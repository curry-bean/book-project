            <h1>MAKAVELI`S PLAYBOOK.</h1>
            
            Here are the playbook Mr. Makaveli has come up with to win the game of life.<br>
            So, what is he game of life. The game of life is a game like any other. <br>
            There are winners and losers. Goals scored and goals conceded. <br>
            Everyone has to play this game. You can`t simply opt to not play. <br>If you do that you automatically lose. You set yourself up to fall on a downward spiral.<br>
            You end up being either a drunk or what we call non-helpful people in society. I don’t think anybody could want to be that person.<br>
            If so, you are just as unhelpful as a corpse. Yes, you could simply die right then and on the spot, and most people won't even shed a tear for your loss.<br>
            As Epictetus has once said, it is a universal law-have no illusion-that every creature alive is attached to nothing so much as to its own self-interest.<br> 
            Hard truth is that everyone has their interest at heart. And they simply won't let yours overtake them just because you asked them nicely.<br>
            The world doesn’t work like that, and if you haven't figured it out, Welcome to the World of the living as I've just assumed that you were dead.<br>
            So how will your interest overtake theirs? By playing the game. And not just playing, but playing to win! The definition of plays being moves.<br>
            Either deceitful ones or half-truths. The whole truth is sometimes not applicable. I bet you have heard that the Truth sets you free. <br>
            This as the youths of our generation would say it is one hundred percent cap. Imagine a guilty man standing in the court of law, and asked if he is guilty.<br>
            There are only two scenarios for him. One in which he says he is guilty. The prosecutor would have an easy time, the judge an even easier time,<br>
            and the man would be sent to jail at a sentence already determined in the constitution. While in the second scenario,<br>
            the prosecutor will have to prove that he is guilty, the judge will have two weighs both sides of the story and the man will have had a chance to play the game. <br>
            One where he ends up innocent/a less steep punishment or guilty. Story being same as there are two sides of a coin. If you flip it, you could either win or lose.<br>
            But let`s face it, due to determinism, some people have a better chance than others. This could be because of wealth, health. And we also have to come into peace with the fact that not everyone will win.<br>
            Just like the history, the winners dictate and write it. If you cannot play, you could choose to back a winning horse, that is what I see most people doing. Women (the female gender unconsciously do it).<br>
            Women are affected by factors like strength as they try to compete, so they join the winning team to also reap the benefits. Men do it so also. One thing everyone should realize is that women are natural survivors.<br>
            That means some will use seduction to lure in men, take the case of Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. Every man wants to protect a woman. It’s a condition that from birth from their mother-son relationship.<br>
            So, they’ll simply fall along with the woman and what they want. It is until one can control this urge that one can take control of his life fully. On the other case women have a nature want to be protected.<br>
            It until they break away from this chain can they take control of their lives. In every relationship, there must be a dominant figure and submissive one. Even in today's couples of the Gay community.<br>
            Today's society however is different from traditional ones. With this I will start with my concepts.

            <h1>Never show your cards, if you want to continue playing.</h1>
      
            Imagine playing poker and at the start or at the middle of the game, you show your cards. The game is as good as over. You could only win if you are damn good player. This means working harder than you would have.<br>
I`ll start with a story free from metaphors. I once sought a young girl, name not relevant for this case. The interaction was equal at the start and end up being a pull-pull from my side and no push from hers. <br>
Reason being is that I told her I liked her. By doing so the thrill from her side was over. The so-called butterflies turned sour to flies. It’s a story written in less than forty words, but the trauma it had caused me,<br>
lasted for a day, until I realized my mistake and got up from my so-called playing injury.<br>
Most however, would have gone into dark state lasting for weeks or even days. <br>
Some start blaming the woman, some go on and blame the whole gender in general. Not being to see that it was their own mistake.<br>
As I say, don’t play with fire if can`t handle the burn cause as death is certain, a burn is in inevitable. 
This scenario could be translated into various sectors of life.<br>
Whether you are smart, never show how smart you are, just show glimpses of your intelligence. Continue attracting the bees with your honey. I once heard a very smart saying from a tv show, attract the flies with honey but if you get a bee sting first. I`ll loosely translate into, attract every person your ‘charm’ attracts but if you get one who challenges you, hurt him or her first. Never go attacking another kingdom, if you could end face a mutiny in yours. Never go into other people's affairs half-cocked but fully armed. If you are wearing your mask, wear it tighter than never before. It’s the only thing protecting you. If you are ashamed of who you are, you could either change yourself or let the fear of the shame propel you 
into making smarter choices in your future.

            <h1>Stay within your element.</h1>
            Your element, your locus of control. What you are good at. My reasoning is that if you are good at lying, be a better or a smarter liar. If you are a good thief, become an intelligent thief. There's a reason you are a natural at lying or at stealing. What the difference between a pick-pocket and an art-thief? There is a huge difference, a pickpocket is thief stealing as a result of surviving or is just a klepto-maniac! <br>
            The art-thief however is stealing to either boast of his prowess or to resell the art at a very high price. Assuming that both of them end up getting caught, guess who`ll be praised? I`ll go with another scenario, <br>
            what's the difference of between a simple liar and a politician? Between the two who will have more money?<br>
            The politician depending on how swiftly he/she moves and how first he`ll cover up his lies, there is a likely chance that he`ll never get caught.
            I`m not at all encouraging people to be thieves and liars.<br>
            However, if you are good at something, be it playing, defending people, scamming people etc.<br>
            Learn how it could end up benefitting you to a much larger scale not just small scale.If you were born a carnivore let's, say a wolf, this places you as a dominant role in the society,<br>
            a predator, learn how to hunt better, camouflage better. A hunter is just as good as his hunting skills. 
            If you were born an herbivore let`s, say zebra, this places you as submissive role in the society, a prey, improve your speed and how best to survive in the wild. A prey surviving the next day, is smarter and has adapted to the hunter's skills than the dead prey.
            Believe it or not, striping of money, buildings and fire etc.,
            we live in the wild and not only the strongest but the smartest will survive.

            <h1>Strategic Support Systems.</h1>
          
            Let`s move to the computer world. For the systems to work great, there must be support systems. Systems to either handle external threats, internal threats, or user-influenced threats.<br>
            I hope this metaphor was well put and clear for all to understand.On the Chessboard, a king is protected by his queen, knights, bishops, castles, and pawns. Like the medieval times,<br> 
            kingdoms are passed down generations. Once born of royal blood one expects the rest to be loyal. The king is the player of the game, the queen is his most powerful and loyal soldier, his bishops are his advisors,<br>
            his knights are the covert operators, the trojan horses, and the castles, well the castles are the foundation of the kingdom. The pawns are the king`s foot-soldiers. And a smart pawn becomes queen.
            The winner of any game is the smartest King. As the metaphor above goes, everyone should have a strong and effective support system strategically put in place. Whether it's emotional or spiritual support, use it.<br>
            A house is only as strong as its foundation. If you are out of sync with your emotional self, have someone or something to put you in your proper self. The same goes for your spiritual self and mental mindset.<br>
            The physical body is merely a vessel, a container for your spiritual, mental, and emotional self. If you are hurt, as long as the mind thinks and the heart pumps the vessel keeps moving.<br> 
            Point is, everyone feels terrible and his ground bottom. However, how fast you pick up yourself determines how best you move up in life. Don’t wallow in your pain, Speak to someone if you must. <br>
            Pray to your spiritual being. Take a walk as you clear up your mind and soul. Take a look, everyone is just as miserable as you. Some don’t even realize it. Instead, they will opt to inebriate their minds to forget it.<br>
            What they don’t know is that the pain cannot just be cleared but solved. 
            If you cannot speak to someone, set up a method a process. Use a process to solve your issues, maybe a game, learn new skills or face them full-on. Fully facing your demons is hard but it's just psychological. Eventually, if you become good at it you could turn off and on the mental switch to be okay.

            <h1>It’s the good ones you have to watch out for.</h1>
            After Adam and Eve, ate the “fruit”, one of the consequences was once the choice of free will. By that everyone has the ability to take what he or she wants. One has the ability to kill for what he or she wants.<br>
            When push comes to shove, the so-called bad guys are harmless. They have already shown their true colors. So, what else would be new? <br>
Deep down, psychologically they have a scar in their memories. A scar riddled deep within many memories functioning as self-defense mechanism.<br>
So, all they have to do is act tough to not be disturbed.<br>
As a hurt animal would bark to scare-off of the predators or as a single lion that scarily roars to scare off an army of encircling hyenas.<br>
So why are good people not bad? Do they not have the capacity to cause harm? Or have they not yet been faced with an incident that triggers the killer in them?<br>
I however see this as a survival instinct. A wolf in sheep`s clothing cannot be disturbed by anyone. A prey will think of it as their own.<br>
A predator trying to attack it, will have a deadly misfortune as the wolf will show off his true colors. So never believe anyone when he says that he or she won`t lie, as why wouldn’t they? Why wouldn`t they hurt you?
<br> Personally, I would prefer one who would openly call himself a liar.
Sharpen your claws, poison your fangs, be ready to kill as an opportunity comes when least expected. But hide the wolf, have the smarts of fox or maybe the owl.<br> 
Cover the killer in you. Protect Hi. Guard it. It will save you when you least expect it as even the wolf becomes the hunted. If you can`t hide your true self, sit on the fence between good and evil.<br>
However, don’t be the sheep that pretends to be bad? Wolves know one of their own. As do lions. Pretending to be one makes you an even bigger prey.<br>
A target to both the predators` as when the time is right you will be the first to be sacrificed and the preys` as they will turn their back on you when most needed<br>
Trust the devil you know but not the angel you don’t know was not coined by a foolish man. The devil might tempt and deceive you, but what else is new?<br>
However, the angel looks like he would help you but might not. Emphasis on the “might not” as at that particular time you will expect to helped only to receive a no.<br>
Same as a hungry man borrowing food only to see it being disposed of to the dumpster. Don't judge the book by its cover, open the book and read it to understand it. 
I didn’t know if you got the moral of the story but here`s the breakdown. Don't act tough when deep down you are not. Be good but have the capability to do evil.

            Building your walls seems safe to anyone hurt or even betrayed. But at what cost is feeling safe and pushing everyone else away. <br>
            There`s a notion that if you go alone, you move fast but if you move together, you go far. What if you could combine going fast and far.<br> 
            It is a fact that everyone believes in what he or she wants to believe. Why not let them? As long as you continue moving on,<br>
            help those you are willing to help and want to be helped. Everyone was given a brain to use them. So let them.<br>
            Let them exercise free will as they chose what to think.Anyway, back to bridges and mirages. Let them see what they want to see.<br>
            As long as it does not cross principles you hold dear. Your principles are your foundations. A house is only as strong as its foundations.<br>

            <h1>Everyone yearns to be dominated. Find the crack in their wall and bust through it.</h1>
          
            It's very clear that everyone has walls built up. Some have built them very up high. But what wall doesn’t have a crack. A sweet spot. I had earlier addressed the issue of not having walls or building mirages around them. You also heard that everyone wants to be a boss. This is because some are not yet bosses and they want that spot. Also remember that fear is better than love. I have noted some examples of cracks from the society.
One is Women, no matter how well the feminine gender acts, even the alpha females, they want to be dominated. Sure, some want more independence from men around them. But if you could subtly undermine them by you dominating them. These women do not want to be dominated by fear but by an alliance where you are the boss. Alliance being the key word. For the less independent women, just dominate them through fear and they won’t even argue with you.<br>
Second is for those who think they are better than you. They claim they are better than you. This may be the result of family wealth or status. These could be dominated by digging their mountain they sit on slowly removing dirt and using the dirt to make your own mountain. Let them not see your mountain though as they could easily undermine yours. <br>
Third is for those who you might be better than but still want a competition with you. For these, raise them up only for you to let fall by themselves further by themselves. Envision someone climbing a mountain you are a higher point than them but they are stuck. Help them pass the stuck point and continue climbing your mountain. If they climb successfully, then you will have an ally. If they don’t, let them fall. Maybe they’ll fall further this time. If they somehow manage to pick themselves up, you’ll still remain the one that once helped them.<br>
Fourth is for those with the ability to climb but won’t. Don’t let them. Yes, this might seem wicked, but it’s not the case. This is as they themselves don’t think they have the ability to climb, so why would you start motivating them. If, however, they start, help them step by step. They will pick you up, if you unfortunately stumble and fall. <br>
Fifth is for those who desperately want to be in charge. Let them sit at the throne if they want to, don’t let them start shouting orders. You could give them your orders for them to give them. He will know he is not in charge. If the ones taking orders, will eventually know he is not in charge.<br>
The key is subtly over a show of power. <br>
Envision a boxer in the ring versus a stronger one. If he jumps around the ring, carefully dodging the punches but successfully lands a powerful punch once you are ready ensures a knockout.<br>
